Question: > What's the difference between "CPU FAN" socket, "CPU OPT" socket, and a "SYS FAN" socket on motherboard? The CPU FAN header is exactly what it says. A typical PC would have a single CPU and a heatsink mounted The fan that is on the front of my h60 radiator is an AF120 Corsair fan that is plugged into the cpu\_opt header. It is running at \~ 4000 rpm. I am trying to get my push/pull situation optimized on the radiator but I can't control the speed of that header through BIOS. Does that header default to max speed no matter what? I checked the specs on the fan and it doesn't look like it should be spinning that fast, unless there is no threshold on power to the fan from that header. It should be spinni.

Do I put the pump power on the cpu opt header. 
I recently got a 240mm AIO cooler, but I've never messed with water cooling before (still am a bit hesitant because my paranoid mind keeps telling me it'll leak) and I know my motherboard isn't great. As far as I know, I plug the pump PWM into the CPU_OPT fan header and use a splitter to put the two fans on the CPU fan header together, correct? Simple (maybe stupid) question but I want to make sure. In case you need to know, I'm using the Gigabyte Z170X-UD3.

Hi guys, So i noticed in my bios my CPU OPT FAN is red but runs at a little bit more speed then my normal CPU FAN both are running at 500 ish cfm in the bios the CPU OPT FAN runs a bit higher 10/20 and is RED. I dont know if the red is bad or not wondering if anyone can answer this and also i noticed if i change it the CPU OPT FAN from PWM to DC it goes up to 800 ish both of them and then he is not red anymore. Meaning maybe DC is better? Hope anyone can clarify this. amp#x200B; Thanks. Bu konu da yazılır mı; ne var bunda çok kolay demeyin. Kırlent yerleştirmede ve renk seçimlerinde çok hata yapılıyor.

Hey guys. So yesterday I was having trouble with my newly built system in that the Kraken x60 wasn't working and it seem to not be cooling my CPU at all. The fans on the radiator were spinning and the LED was lit on the block, but my temps would jump to 70-80C in the BIOS. So I shut it down. I have triple checked everything. The two fans are in the 4 pin fan cable off the block (and in the right order), the CPU block is firmly seated with thermal paste, and the 3 pin fan header Проверь imei номер своего мобильного телефона.

Hello Reddit! Recently my PC started locking up and having to be hard reset to work again. This happened more and more frequently until this happened within 10 minutes of being reset every time.

I recently installed a new rx480 video card and upgraded from windows 7 to windows 10.

The issue I have is that when I plug either D5 pump into the CPU or CPU OPT fan header, the pump does not spin, it goes down to 0%. When I plug the pump into a chassis fan header, the pump runs at it should and goes to 100% (~4,700 RPM). This behavior occurs with either of the D5 pumps so I assume they're not at fault. I would like to use the CPU headers as it will be a bit of a failsafe should a pump die, but I can't. so im trying to configure my fans in AI Suite 3, there are 6 fan headers but there is no option for the opt fan. so how can i change the fan option for that? i got cpu fan chassis 1 chassis 2 chassis 3 chassis 4 i need CPU opt fan motherboard is Asus z97 pro wifi any ideas.

Hi there, Trying to get info about the behaviour of the CPU_OPT fan port on Asus P8Z77 mother boards. What I really want to know is if it just mimicks whatever the CPU Fan port does? (Asus doesn't give any control over it in the BIOS as far as I can see from the manual) I intend to get a Phanteks TC14PE which has 2 PWM fans, can I plug them into CPU and CPU_OPT, or am I better off using the splitter cable provided? (I want them to run at the same speed). Thanks, EDIT - in brackets. Hope you can help me. I have ASUS Z87-A motherboard paired with a i5-4670K and a Cooler Master 212 evo cpu cooler. I had just one fan on the cooler. So my CPU fan header doesn't work anymore. I am currently using the CPU_OPT fan header instead and it seems to be working fine. Is there any downside to doing this?

Just thought I'd share something i found last night (maybe it's obvious but i didn't realise). I have a Asrock Fatal1ty X370 k4 board with ryzen 1600x and a noctua NH-D14 cpu cooler (2 fans, giant cooler of doom). In the monitor section of the bios, you can change what is the reference basis for the speed of all the fans on the board (either to pay attention to cpu temps or motherboard temps), which is great. The thing is, cpu-opt fan header by default sets to listen to motherboard temps

I have bought a Seidon 120M water cooler and a Gigabyte UD4H board. The issue is I dont know which sockets the pump and the exhaust fan should. For a previous PC I had an old ASUS motherboard that had CPU and CPU_OPT fan headers that worked in PWM. The other three CHA fan headers, despite having four pins, were only voltage controlled. They also could not be controlled individually. Is it like this for all motherboards? Is it just ASUS? And what boards would I have to choose from if I wanted multiple fan "channels" that can be controlled separately with actual PWM control.
