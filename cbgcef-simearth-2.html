Является самостоятельной игрой в серии SimEarth is a life simulation video game, the second designed by Will Wright, in which the player controls the development of a planet. The game was published in 1990 by Maxis. I'm wondering if there's any modern game like what I'm thinking of. I really want to play something like SimEarth but made today, more accessible, more modern in controls and UI. Lots of interaction between elements, where you can kind of just watch how the different mechanics work together.

Like many games in the series Sims, Sim Earth has no specific purpose, the challenge I'm looking to do a month of video game vaporwave for the Retro Weather Channel ( Other than the Tetris CD-I soundtrack, maybe the Pilotwings 64 and Simearth SNES OSTs, and Pleasant Specter (https://pleasantspecter.bandcamp.com/releases), could I get some recommendations for vaporwave releases that could pass for video game music or video game OSTs that are very vaporwave? I'd like to lean more towards jazzy/MIDI since that works better with the Weather. Add extension button. That's it.

So I picked Doom (2016) up the other week and it has been the best gaming experience I've had in years. I've been a PC guy since I was 12 (way back in 1993) when we first got SimEarth and Wing Commander. Doom was either gotten via a friend (god, the old shareware days) or bought at Salisbury (State, at the time) University at the book store where they usually had a decent selection of shareware and shovelware. Doom was an instant hit with my brother and I, having played Wolfenstein Let's Stream: SimEarth (DOS) Commander Useless.  SimEarth: Tragedy of the Bird People A Review - Duration: 10:17  11:42.

I haven't played the Creatures games but I've been reading about them lately and they sound like a fantastic idea, but at this point, they also sound pretty out of date. Is there a reason we haven't been seeing more of this sort of thing? Did Spore make everybody believe this genre isn't wanted or was it just not wanted to begin with? Do you think Maxis could remake SimEarth or SimAnt

I am concerned with if they came in a big box or if they were jewel case only releases. They do not have barcodes on them. The discs appear to be normal releases but the jewel case is clear plastic and the inlay/back is not the same as a retail big box release.

I googled it and didn't find any ready remakes for Simearth-like games/models (not counting arcades like Spore).

I've always loved the idea of a game where I could directly create and develop a planet. Then I remembered a game a played a wee boy called SimEarth developed by Maxis. I scoured the web and found that I can emulate the game easily enough. Wouldn't be great if there were a remake of the game using today's graphics, updated data on planetary scienc.
